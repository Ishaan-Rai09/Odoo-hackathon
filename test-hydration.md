# Hydration Fix Test

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to theme-dependent icon rendering in the navbar component. The error occurred because:

1. Server-side rendering: `theme` is undefined or has default value
2. Client-side hydration: `theme` gets actual value from localStorage
3. This causes Sun/Moon icons to be different between server and client renders

## Solution Applied
1. Added `mounted` state to track when component has hydrated
2. Only render theme-dependent icons after component has mounted
3. Show fallback Moon icon during initial render

## Changes Made
- Added `mounted` state in navbar component
- Added useEffect to set mounted to true after hydration
- Wrapped theme-dependent icon rendering with mounted check
- Applied fix to both desktop and mobile theme toggle buttons
- Wrapped authentication-dependent rendering with mounted check
- Applied fix to both desktop and mobile auth sections
- Added fallback rendering for both theme and auth states during initial render

## Expected Result
- No more hydration errors related to theme toggle icons
- Theme toggle functionality still works correctly
- Consistent rendering between server and client

## Test Steps
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the application in browser
3. Check browser console for hydration errors
4. Test theme toggle functionality
5. Verify no console errors appear
